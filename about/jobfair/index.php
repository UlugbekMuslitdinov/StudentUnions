	Known as the kitchen and living room of the University of Arizona, the Student Unions is a place where everyone can eat, play, relax, and get involved! We strive to provide a "home away from home" for students, and we'd love to have you on our team!<br /><br />
        
    With the job market recovering, additional covid unemployment benefits coming to an end, and state incentives for attaining employment now available, the University is seeking qualified candidates to join our team for the upcoming academic year. As on-campus enrollment returns to pre-pandemic levels, we are planning to re-open 100% of our operations, so now is an ideal time to apply.
