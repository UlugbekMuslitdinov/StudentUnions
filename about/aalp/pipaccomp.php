<p><b>Restaurant Management</b>
</p>
<p>
Many PIP students from our Dining Services departments become leads or assistant mangers within their restaurants, including: Café Sonora, Canyon Café, and IQ Fresh. In their new positions, they learn about day-to-day management from their full-time supervisor.  These students also work to ensure the student perspective is always represented in Dining Services!

		<p>
			One PIP student conducted research on all recipes and products served in Dining Services. After identifying those that contained trans-fats and communicating with vendors about the products, the student worked to greatly reduce the use of trans-fats in Student Union restaurants and food outlets.  Trans-fats have been entirely eliminated in some areas!

<p>
Developed and coordinated by a PIP student, the new "<a href="http://www.union.arizona.edu/tellus">Tell Us!</a>" customer service assessment campaign works to improve customer satisfaction within the Unions.  The campaign includes an online feedback tool, mystery shoppers, and regular point-of-sale surveys.
