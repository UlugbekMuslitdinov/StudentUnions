		<p>
			Mr. Sharp's master&rsquo;s report, entitled &ldquo;Reining in Sprawl: Towards a New Western Ruralism&rdquo; won the Merit Award in the Professional Research Category from the Arizona Chapter of American Society of Landscape Architects.  What is significant here is that his work was the only award in that category.  His work was in competition with the professional firms, government agencies and other students from across state.  The commendation cited his unique approach in the challenges in dealing with urban and ex-urban sprawl as ranch land comes under development pressure.  His proposal was based on a solid investigative technique rooted in case studies as well as his own experiences as a retired Southern Arizona rancher where he recognized the practical aspects and realities of the change that is occurring in our rural landscape.
