	<h2 class="expand" >How many hours will I need to work?</h2>
	<div class="collapse">
		<p>
		The hours you work per week depends on you. When you apply you are asked to fill in the times you would like to work. Managers use 
		this to schedule shifts. The Unions always take your class schedule into consideration and realize you are a student first.
		</p>
		<p>
		If you are applying to a specific job from our available jobs list, make sure you read it carefully as some managers request a 
		preferred number of hours. As a student you can work anywhere from about 4 hours up to 30 hours a week (20 for international students).

		If you have completed your FAFSA and received your financial award letter stating you have qualified for work study, you are considered

		welcomes any work study eligible student to apply, as all jobs at the Union accept Federal Work Study. If you do not have work study 
		you can still apply, but be aware that a few positions, such as in the Center for Student Involvement and Leadership, require work study. 
		You can check if you are work study on Student Link. During the first week of August forms will become available to you on student link 
		to give to your employer.

	<h2 class="expand" >Once I apply, when will I be contacted?</h2>
	<div class="collapse">
		<p>
		The Unions have around 40 units that hire students, and even more if you include our internship sites. Depending on where you applied to, the time 
		it takes for you to be contacted may vary. Please be patient as our managers are very busy. If you are extremely interested in a certain position, 
		feel free to contact the manager at that unit and give them your name and contact information. This could increase your chances of gaining employment 
		in that specific area.

	<h2 class="expand" >What if I have not been contacted yet?</h2>
	<div class="collapse">
		<p>
		If you have not been contacted within 4 weeks of applying you will receive an email message detailing further instructions and information. Please 
		check you email regularly for updates. Check to make sure you entered a complete schedule on your application. You may not be contacted if you only 
		marked a few hours or half hours. We have found that some students only check a few boxes, and this limits their chances. While there are no minimum 
		hours you need to work, keep in mind the length of a proper shift is. Most shifts at our locations are about 4 hours long. Also make sure you applied 
		to the areas, units, and departments you are really interested in. If you apply to a unit that is not hiring be advised you may not be contacted at all.
		</p>
		<p>
		Finally, applying to the Arizona Student Unions does not guarantee employment. If you are not hired we suggest you visit 
		<a href="http://www.career.arizona.edu/">Career Services</a> or <a href="https://www.career.arizona.edu/Auth/WebAuthLogin.aspx?ReturnUrl=/Restricted/JobLink/">Wildcat 
		Joblink</a> for other on campus opportunities.
