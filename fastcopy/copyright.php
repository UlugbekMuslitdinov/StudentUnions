<h1>FAST COPY Copyright Guidelines<img src="/fastcopy/copyright.gif" width="150" height="150" border="0" align="right"></h1>
<h2><i>Copyrighted Materials (need copyright clearance)</i></h2>
<p>&#149; Anything, which bears the following symbols: &copy;, &#153;, &reg;<br>
	
	
	&#149; Any graph, table, etc. from a copyrighted work<br>
	
	
	&#149; Anything from a book, journal or magazine<br>
	
	
	&#149; Movie posters, video box covers, CD jackets, cartoon strips, song lyrics, sheet music<br>
	<br>
</p>
<h2>Public Domain</h2>
<p>&#149; Articles from newspapers<br>
	
	
	&#149; Government documents<br>
	<br>
</p>
<h2>May be copied under Fair Use</h2>
<p>&#149; In all cases only ONE COPY may be made without copyright clearance:<br>
	
	
	&#149; No more than 10% or 1 chapter may be copied from a book (whichever is less)<br>
	
	
	&#149; In a book of poetry, one poem from one author may be copied.  If the book is a collection, up to 5 poems may be copied (all must be from separate authors).<br>
	
	
	&#149; One graph, table, figure, etc. may be copied<br>
	
	
	&#149; One song from a collection or by different authors, sheet music<br>
	<br>
</p>
<h2>Special Cases</h2>
<p>&#149; If the professor is the author of the article in questions he/she may still not own the copyright (the journal periodical in which the article is published would own the copyright). Follow the above guidelines.</p>
<p>&#149; If someone claims to have obtained copyright clearance on their own to make copies of a specific document, we need a copy of this permission in writing before we can make the copies.</p>
<p>&#149; Under no situation should we make copies of professionally done pictures (i.e. Olan Mills), any cartoon characters, trademarked logos (i.e. Nike Swoosh, Target logo), or greeting cards (text or photo).</p>
<p>&#149; Any ambiguous situations should be checked with the Copyright Department before agreeing to do the job.<br>
	<br>
</p>
<h2>How long does copyright last?</h2>
<p>&#149; For works created after January 1, 1978, copyright protection will endure for the life of the author plus an additional 70 years.  In the case of a joint work, the term lasts for 70 years after the last surviving author&#146;s death.  For anonymous and pseudonymous works and works made for hire, the term will be 95 years from the year of first publication or 120 years from the year of creation, whichever expires first.</p>
<p>&#149; For works created but not published or registered before January 1, 1978, the term endures for life of the author plus 70 years, but in no case will expire earlier than December 31, 2002.  If the work is published before December 31, 2002, the term will not expire before December 31, 2047.</p>
<p>&#149; For pre-1978 works still in their original or renewal term of copyright, the total term is extended to 95 years from the date that copyright was originally secured.</p>
