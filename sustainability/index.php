<p style="">The Arizona Student Unions are looking to set an example for the University
and Tucson communities by offering programming, resources, and processes
that enhance and promote our sustainability.</p>

<b>the definition:</b> <br />
<p style="">Sustainability is the ability to to meet the environmental economic and social needs of the present without
compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs.

<p><b>our efforts ... </b> <br />
The Arizona Student Unions have been and are continuing to engage in over 20 sustainability
efforts along our triple bottom line: Environmental Justice (Green) initiatives, Social Justice
Initiatives, and Economic Justice Initiatives. For a detailed list, see the "sustainability efforts"
page. Note that this page is always changing, and is not complete, so check back often to see
the latest in sustainable thinking at the Unions.</p>

<p><b>the committee ... </b> <br />
In our effort as an organization to be mindful of our triple bottom line, we have formed
a committe that regularly meets to bring current efforts to light, initiate needed efforts,
consider suggestions, and find ways to implement needed sustainability programs. If you have
suggestions you would like to have considered, see below.</p>
