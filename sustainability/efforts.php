1. <a href="http://www.union.arizona.edu/csil/sjlc/">Social Justice Programs</a> form a large portion of the Center for Student Involvement &amp; Leadership (CSIL). <b>We work to honor different
heritage months and identities.</b> One of our most recent initiatives was the mock-border spanning the UA Mall sparking countless
conversations and dialogue across campus.
<br /><br />
<!--2. The Arizona Blue Chip Program has a four-year Social Entrepreneurship leadership track in which students are exposed to innovative
business practices for social change, learning to work with the double bottom line of financial and social impact.
<br /><br />-->

create successful initiatives.
<br /><br />
3. The Women's Resource Center invites the Tucson community to their film series at <a href="http://www.union.arizona.edu/gallagher/">Gallagher Theater</a> on the first and third
Wednesday of the month, addressing issues facing today's women. All of these movies and their discussions are free and open
to the public.
<br /><br />
4. In partnership with CSIL's Social Justice Programs, the <a href="https://orgsync.com/:atlas">
ATLAS Social Justice Leadership certificate</a> is designed to give participants
an opportunity to learn about power, privilege, and systems of oppression as well as
tools to fight social injustice. Participants attend workshops and earn a certification in
social justice leadership. These workshops are free and open to the public.
<br /><br />
5. The <strong><a href="https://orgsync.com/:bluechip/">Arizona Blue Chip Program</a> has a four-year Service leadership track</strong> in

change through service initiatives including activism, direct service, or lifestyle
change.

<br /><br />

1. Every Wednesday, economic barriers don't separate who is "eating out" and who isn't on the UA campus. <strong>The <a href="http://www.union.arizona.edu/cheapeats/">Savvy Student program</a></strong> enables students who may not be able to afford eating out very often an opportunity to come to the Unions' eateries all
across campus and eat with their friends.
<br /><br />

equipment at the UA Arizona Agricultural Experiment Stations.
<br /><br />
2. We currently <strong>recycle cardboard, number 10 tin cans, plastic bottles, aluminum, white paper, and newsprint</strong>. Behind the scenes, the Unions staff are recycling almost
as much �OCC� corrugated cardboard as the rest of our recycled items combined. <a

<br /><br />
3. Since 2005, there has been a marked decrease in Unions waste as well as an increase in recycling.
<br /><br />
4. Class notes sold in the UA BookStore now have a "This is recyclable" message. Students have returned about 50 a semester.
<br /><br />
5. The new Student Union Memorial Center uses more <strong>efficient dual glass pane windows</strong>, has decreased lighting needs, improved
air quality, and more efficient HVAC and support systems.
<br /><br />
6.<strong> <a href="http://www.union.arizona.edu/fastcopy/">Fast Copy</a> has begun collecting Hewlett-Packard (HP) printer cartridges</strong> to be recycled in bulk, reducing the carbon it takes to
make multiple truck deliveries for single cartridges.
<br /><br />
7.<strong> <a href="http://www.union.arizona.edu/fastcopy/">Fast Copy</a> uses paper only from SFI (Sustainable Forest Initiative)</strong> qualified companies, and is working to use papers with high
recycled content whenever possible.
<br /><br />
8. <strong><a href="http://www.union.arizona.edu/cgi-bin/WebObjects/Catering.woa/wa/default">Redington catering</a></strong> in the skyboxes and the stadium club are now using fully <strong>compostable plates</strong>.
<br /><br />
9. The <strong><a href="/dining/sumc/cellar">Cellar Bistro</a> serves environmentally-friendly pond raised shrimp</strong> from Desert Sweet Shrimp, near Gila Bend. This Unions'
restaurant also serves <strong>free-range, grass fed, no hormone natural beef</strong> from the San Rafael Valley, here in Arizona.
<br /><br />
10. The Unions are working with Residence Life to find <strong>"green" cleaning products</strong> that will hold up to our heavy-duty cleaning needs.
We have eliminated all of the harsh chemicals from the cleaning products, and we use foam soap decreasing hand soap usage in
all our bathrooms.
<br /><br />
11. The <strong><a href="https://orgsync.com/:bluechip/">Arizona Blue Chip Program</a> has a four-year Ecology leadership track</strong> in which students develop an understanding of socially
responsible leadership in maintaining the synchronicity of humanity and nature.
<br /><br />
12. All the <strong>Unions' convenience stores (Umart, Highland, Park Ave, Bookend) carry UA recycler mugs</strong>. If you purchase a refill of coffee
or soda in these containers, you receive a significant discount.

<b>planned efforts ...</b>

<br /><br />

1. We are piloting automated light systems in some of our storage and non-customer spaces. After the results are gathered, we
hope to expand to more parts of the Unions.<br /><br />
2. The Unions are testing waterless urinals. After the results are gathered, we hope to expand usage. "Conventional urinals use
at least three liters of water per flush (about a gallon), whereas flushless urinals need neither water nor a flushing system, and
improve hygiene." [Aster, Kropfl and Zender]

<br /><br />
