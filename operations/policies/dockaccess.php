    		<p style="margin-top: 2px;">To provide the optimal level of service to the Underground
			loading dock (See vendor Loading Dock Diagram), the following
			procedures must be followed and adhered to at all times (<i>failure
			to comply will result in ticketing or towing</i>):</p>
		<ul>
		<li>The dock is managed by Union Operations who have
			delegates assigned throughout the day. The primary contact
			is the Asst. Director of Operations and can be reached at
			360-3525. If unavailable, please call Student Union Receiving
			at 621-7040.</li>
		<br />
		<li>POST OFFICE PRIORITY: Any deliveries to the rst small truck
			bay 1 must be in accordance with the assigned hours for the
			Post Oce. To facilitate US MAIL delivery, no one may park in
			this space between 11am-12pm and 2:45-3:15pm.</li>
		<br />
		<li>Deliveries are dened as drop of goods or materials to the
			Student Union Memorial Center.</li>
		<br />
		<li>The Purpose of the loading dock is for deliveries and
			loading/unloading of vehicles only. The loading dock is not a
			parking facility. NO UNATTENDED VEHICLES are allowed in
		the loading dock.</li>
		<br />
		<li>In the case that an outside service vendor (or Student Union
			Service Vehicle) needs to unload heavy equipment etc and
			needs limited short term unattended parking (MAX 2 hours),
			this can only be accommodated in the "Building Services"
			space. This space is located next to the 2 recycle compactors
			(See Diagram) and is also clearly marked with signage and
			pavement marking.<br />
		<strong>THIS SPACE IS NOT AVAILABLE UNTIL 8AM.</strong></li>

		<h3>UNION STAFF</h3>
		<p style="margin-top: 2px;">All designated union staff with access to the dock will have their <a href="http://www.catcard.arizona.edu" target="_blank">CatCards</a>, vendor
	        /vehicle card or a remote unit to open the gate.</p>
	        
		<h3>OUTSIDE VENDORS</h3>
		<p style="margin-top: 2px;">Retail vendors within the union as well as outside vendors that deliver to the union have a vendor card that allows them access.</p>
		
		<h3>ALL OTHERS</h3>
		<p style="margin-top: 2px;">Anyone wanting access to the dock after hours when the gate is closed and while the Student Union Memorial Center is still open will have to do the following:</p>
		<p>Stop at top of ramp, get out and use the call box to call the Information Counter or Operations Manager (OM) Cell phone (at the same time, the signal light will take 45 seconds to go from red to green). The Info phone or OM cell phone will ring and the vendor will ask for access. OM's should check the monitor to see who it is and then go to the dock, swipe card and gate will open.</p>
		<p>*<b><i>OM's will need to swipe card to open gate for these vendors when they need to leave.</i></b></p>
		
		<h3>IMPORTANT REMINDERS</h3>
		<ol style="margin-left: 25px; margin-top:5px; margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.5em;">
			<li>Drivers must wait until the gate <b><i><u>is all the way up before</u></i></b> they enter the dock or the gate will not automatically close behind them.</li>
			<li>Call box is only set to talk for 60 seconds</li>
			<li>OM's to use Catcard at all times when opening dock gate. The key is for emergency override use only.</li>
