	Recognizing the need for safe social activities, the University of Arizona Student Unions developed these general guidelines for dances held in 
	Arizona Student Unions' facilities. Please review this policy prior to submitting your request for facility use. 
</p>

<p>
	Please note that this dance policy is primarily used for University of Arizona recognized clubs and organizations holding dances within the 
	Student Union. Private groups, University departments or non-University organizations hosting dances follow approximately the same policies 
	with some exceptions. Please speak with an Event planner directly if your event falls in to the category of a private event or non-University 
	dance so all the details of your event can be discussed in advance. Failure to meet all the Student Union policies and procedures for events 
	with dances will result in cancellation of the event.

	<h2 class="expand" >Definitions</h2>
	<div class="collapse">
		<p>
		This policy applies to any recognized student club/organization that wishes to have a dance in a Student Unions' facility. 
		A dance is defined as a social gathering where the primary focus is to dance for entertainment purposes. A guest is defined 
		as a dance participant who is not a member of the sponsoring organization(s) and is invited by a member to attend in accordance 
		with the following guidelines.

			The sponsoring organization is responsible for the behavior of its members and guests. All guests must be at least 18 years of age 
			with valid photo identification. <br />

			<li>Each student entering the dance is allowed one (1) guest who must sign a guest list. Only one guest per organization member applies to all dances.</li>
			<li>The organization is to submit a pre-printed member and guest list with the first and last names. The guest list must be submitted to the Event Services Office seventy-two (72) hours prior to the dance.</li>

	<h2 class="expand" >Security</h2>
	<div class="collapse">
		<p>
			Security is required for all student dances. Security requirements are determined in conjunction with UAPD (University of Arizona Police Department) 
			and UA Risk Management. Considerations include the dance day, time and place, expected attendance, expected number of guests not on the pre-printed 
			guest list, the past history of the event, the type of event itself and the sponsoring organization. UAPD will provide security for all dances in the 
			Student Union Memorial Center. <u>The client or sponsoring organization is responsible for contacting UAPD and making all necessary security arrangements.</u> 
			A request for security personnel should be made at least 3 weeks before the event to ensure UAPD has time to staff the event. Please contact Melissa Valenzuela  
			at 626-6728 for information on cost or to schedule police officers. University Risk Management may require additional security and this will be discussed 
			with Client as far ahead as possible. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>UAPD contact is Melissa Valenzuela  at 626-6728.</b> UAPD will decide how many officers are necessary for the dance and all arrangements including payment 
			are to be made directly with the UAPD contact. In addition, the following will also apply:
		</p>

		<ol style="line-height: 1.25em;">
			<li>The sponsoring organization must identify one (1) individual member who will specifically be charged with the responsibility for assisting with security. This individual shall be stationed at the door throughout the dance to take an accurate head count.</li>
			<li>The sponsoring organization/representative must also check identification, collect admission fees, and communicate with security and Student Union staff. These individuals must check with the Union's Operations Manager before the doors open for the dance.</li>
			<li>All dance participants are subject to pat down. Purses/fanny packs may be searched. No large bags, (i.e., backpacks), are permitted.</li>
			<li>Participants who choose to leave the designated dance area must repeat the complete security screening process and pay any admission fees again.</li>
			<li>If anticipated attendance and the security of the facility necessitate, the University Police Department and/or Arizona Student Unions reserve the right to require the sponsoring organization to hire additional security. In such cases, every effort will be made to discuss these concerns with the sponsoring organization as far in advance as possible.</li>
			<li>The Arizona Student Unions and/or security reserve the right to refuse admission to anyone.</li>
			<li>The Arizona Student Unions reserves the right to close the dance or end the event at any time if they feel that canceling the dance is in the best interest and safety of the dance guests and/or Student Union Memorial Center staff.</li>

				The Student Union Memorial Center Grand Ballroom University rate: $800 /Non-University rate: beginning rate: $1500 to $3000 Please note that the

				conflicts with neighboring events. 1. Cleaning - There are minimum cleaning charges for all dances. Additional cleaning charges may be assessed 
				as needed to restore the facility to its original state. The minimum cleaning charge is $150.00.
			</li>

				closes, this includes increments of hours. Groups will be charged the full hourly rate regardless of whether they stay in the building for the
				full hour over or not. This includes DJ equipment and load-out. The charge goes up to $200/hour after 1am. It is important to schedule the end 
				time of the dance to assure there is sufficient time to load out for the event. 
			</li> 
			<li>
				Damage Charges - The sponsoring organization will be charged for any damages that occur during the dance.
				<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;" >
