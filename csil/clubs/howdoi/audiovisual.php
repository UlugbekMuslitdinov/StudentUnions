<h1>Audio Visual Equipment</h1>The University of Arizona Student Unions provides audio-visual equipment for events within the Student Union. To reserve projectors, screens, extension cords, etc., your student organization&#146;s president or vice president must order the equipment from the Event Scheduling Office at least three days in advance.<p>Clubs are allowed to reserve equipment when available at no charge. If equipment needs to be ordered from the University Teaching Center a charge will be applied.</p>
<p>If using ASUA funds, an Inter-Departmental Requisition (IDR) is required, otherwise, cash from the organization&#146;s personal account is acceptable. Call University Teaching Center at 621-3852 for fee information.</p>
