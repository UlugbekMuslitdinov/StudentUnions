<h1>Mail Boxes</h1>
<p><b>Private</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>There is a U.S. Postal Service Contract Station in the Student Union Memorial Center. Your organization can have a secure, private mailbox in a location that is accessible whenever the SUMC is open.
	<li>All recognized student organizations receive a discounted rate of $40 per year. Department boxes are also available for $100 per year.
	<li>If your organization wishes to do so, you can maintain the same box each year so that your organization will have a permanent United States Postal Service mailing address.
	<li>Mail for your organization can be sent to:<br>
		Organization Name, Box No.,<br>
		1303 E. University Blvd.,<br>
		Tucson, Arizona 85719&#150;0521<br>
		Stop by the Post Office (east wing of the SUMC) to arrange for a private mailbox.
</ul>
