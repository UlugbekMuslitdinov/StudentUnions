<h2>How Do I?</h2>

<b>Start a Club</b>
<br />
<p>Before you begin the fun process of forming a new student organization, check out the listings to research what organizations already exist. These groups have been formed to meet a variety of personal, social, political, recreational, leadership and religious interests. You may find that there is already a group on campus doing exactly what you wanted to do. It is often more effective to combine forces that duplicate efforts and/or services thereby creating competition for resources--financial or people. Most organizations are very eager for new members; they want talents, new ideas, enthusiasm and commitment. If there is a group of people meeting with basically the same interests as yours, it makes sense for you to join forces and become fast allies.</p>

<p>If, however, you are unable to identify an existing organization that will satisfy you, then by all means, start your own. There are many others out there with similar interests as yours looking for a group to join!<br /><br />

There are specific guidelines to be followed in order to be recognized by The University of Arizona. You will find them in the Student Organization Handbook in great detail but here are the basics.<br /><br />

Take these three basic steps and then come to the Center for Student Involvement &amp; Leadership, room 404 of the Student Union, for the paperwork.<br /><br />

1. Find at least one other person to help you organize. One of you will be listed as president and one as the treasurer. You may not hold both positions.<br /><br />

2. Locate an advisor. Your advisor must be a fulltime faculty or staff member at the University. It may not be a teaching assistant (T.A.) or graduate assistant.<br /><br />

3. Create a constitution using the sample in the Organization Handbook. Be certain to include the mandatory phrases exactly as they are included in the sample.<br /><br />

If you need assistance with any of these steps or if you need a hard copy of the Student Organization Handbook come to the Center for Student Involvement &amp; Leadership, Room 404 of the Student Union.<br />

<b>Opening An Off-Campus Bank Account</b> <br />

<p>Why: An organization that raises money separate from the funds appropriated to it by ASUA or a University department will need to have an off-campus bank account to deposit and draw funds from.<br /><br />

Where: Many student organizations choose to use Vantage Credit Union because of their location and familiarity with University student organization checking accounts. You may choose any bank you feel comfortable with.<br /><br />

If you decide to open an account with Vantage, you must obtain a letter of recognition from the Center for Student Involvement &amp; Leadership.<br /><br />

How: To open an account you will need either a student�s social security number (not a good idea) or a tax ID number. Apply for a tax ID number using form SS-4. Forms are available here!<br /><br />

Restrictions: You may not use �The University of Arizona� or �UA� as part of the organization name on your account. University funds, including ASUA monies may not be in an off-campus account.<br /><br />
