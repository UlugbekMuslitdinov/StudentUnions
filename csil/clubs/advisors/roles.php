<h1>What is the Role of an Advisor?</h1>
<p>Advisors are first and foremost educators. In this role you will provide information, present alternatives, encourage responsibility, support creativity, and challenge students to develop as leaders. In this role an advisor walks a fine line between leading the organization and giving the organization the strength to lead itself.</p>
<p>Advisors should not assume a role as a leader, officer, or voting member within the student organization. The various &#147;hats&#148; of an advisor can be placed into four categories: planning assistance, leadership skill development, resource guidance/policy interpretation, and transition.</p>
<p><b>Planning Assistance</b><br>
	The advisor will advise students in planning projects, competitions, events, or programs for the organization. This may include planning a meeting or social, fundraising drive, community service event, or sports event. Students often need assistance in ordering the process, involving other members or logistical considerations. They may not know the questions to ask.</p>
<p><b>Leadership Skill Development</b><br>
	Student leaders come into their positions with various levels of ability. If the advisor develops a relationship of trust the student will benefit from guidance in areas such as assertiveness, budgeting, time management as well as helping the group with problem solving, decision&#150;making, cohesiveness. The advisor may work directly with officers in developing individual skills like public speaking and letter writing, or officers may ask him or her to assist in ways to increase motivation.</p>
<p>Advisors serve as liaisons between the university and the organization by providing information regarding university procedures and guidelines and making appropriate contacts. It is not the responsibility of the advisor to find monetary resources but students frequently need some guidance in deciding where to start.</p>
<p><b>Transition</b><br>
	Many organizations at The University of Arizona need assistance in transitioning officers. As advisor you can help by offering to meet with the out&#150;going and in&#150;coming officers to discuss expectations and re&#150;cap the previous term of office. Your presence as a facilitator will guide the students to exchange needed information.</p>
<p><b>Suggested Tasks for Advisors</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>Assist the group in filing its Recognition Packet, an annual requirement of The University of Arizona.
	<li>Create opportunities for the educational and personal development of students.
	<li>Have a knowledge of all plans and activities of the group.
	<li>Discourage domination of the group by any individual or small groups.
	<li>Assist in the orientation of new officers.
	<li>Be available to meet with members of the organization at their regular meetings and events sponsored by the group. If the group meets weekly plan on attending at least once a month.
	<li>Provide guidance in the planning and evaluation of programs.
	<li>Assist the group in setting realistic goals and objectives for the academic year. Facilitators are available at the Center for Student Involvement &amp; Leadership, 621-8046 to help with this task.
	<li>Promote closer involvement between students, faculty and staff. Suggest the group apply for faculty student interaction monies (see the Funding Section of the Handbook.)
	<li>Assist the group in abiding by all University policies, procedures, and regulations.
	<li>Be familiar with the Policy Section of the Handbook.
</ul>
<p><b>Techniques of Advising</b></p>
<p>Understanding what a student officer expects of an advisor and what an advisor may expect of a student officer may enable one to more effectively fulfill the role of an advisor. It is strongly suggested that before agreeing to sign the annual recognition papers, advisors should meet with the student leaders to determine mutual expectations. Listed here are guidelines that may be helpful in determining these expectations.</p>
<p><b>What a Student Officer May Expect of an Advisor:</b><br>
	
	&#149;	Assist the group in formulating long&#150;range goals and in planning and initiating short&#150;term projects.<br>
	
	&#149;	Assistance with University procedural matters.<br>
	
	&#149;	Suggestions of ways the group meetings can be improved.<br>
	
	&#149;	Assist in evaluating group projects, performance, and progress.<br>
	&#149; Make suggestions that will permit the officers to improve leadership skills.</p>
<p><b>What an Advisor may Expect of a Student Officer:</b><br>
	
	&#149;	Keep advisor informed of all organizational activities, meeting times, locations, and agendas.<br>
	
	&#149;	Provide advisor with minutes of all meetings.<br>
	&#149; Meet regularly with the advisor and use him/her as a sounding board for discussing plans and problems.</p>
<p><b>Different Approaches to Advising:</b><br>
	The most important aspect of advising is to remember that one&#146;s main role is just that&#150;to advise. The suggestions listed below are meant to help the advisor work more effectively with the student organization in the role of an advisor.</p>
<p>&#149; Point out issues relating to ideas presented by the officer without imposing bias.<br>
	
	&#149;	If an idea is inappropriate, the advisor should encourage the students to consider other alternatives. <br>
	
	&#149;	Informal meetings are conductive to open and worthwhile discussion.<br>
	
	&#149;	If the officer asks &#147;What should we do?&#148; or &#147;What do you think?&#148; the question should be rephrased and handed back to him/her. The advisor is there to assist the officer but not to solve the problem for the student.<br>
	
	&#149;	The officer should be encouraged to take an occasional chance on some less proven members in delegating authority.<br>
	
	&#149;	The advisor may wish to periodically evaluate the student in his/her effectiveness as an officer.<br>
	
	&#149;	The advisor may feel comfortable participating in group discussions when the members have learned to recognize and accept the advisor&#146;s role as a co&#150;worker whose opinions are respected for their value. This participation should not inhibit the perogatives of anyone else.<br>
