<h1>Advisor Resources</h1>
<p>The Center for Student Involvement &amp; Leadership provides resources for student organization advisors.</p>
<p>The Leadership Resource Library offers books to assist in planning retreats, skill development and specific guidance on how to advise student organizations. Staff members are trained in conflict mediation that is sometimes needed for student groups or for students and advisors.</p>
<p>The staff at the Center for Student Involvement &amp; Leadership is available to discuss your role as advisor. Concerns about liability, use of resources, interpretation of policy, students who manipulate others via their office or appropriateness of group activities are common. Feel free to call 621-8046 if you would like to discuss advisor concerns or available resources.</p>
<p><b>Finances: Bank Accounts</b><br>
	Many organizations have off&#150;campus bank accounts. If you advise a student organization with an off&#150;campus account ask the President what safe guards are in place. They should have a Tax ID Number rather than using a social security number. You may offer to be a co&#150;signer in order to help facilitate transition. This is a personal decision which works well for some organizations. Make it clear you will not be responsible for tracking their finances.</p>
<p><b>Access to Student Information</b><br>
	As a faculty member you may have access to mailing addresses of enrolled students. Please carefully read the Bulk Mail section of the Student Organization Handbook. You may not provide labels to a Recognized Student Organization They must follow the guidelines in this Handbook.</p>
