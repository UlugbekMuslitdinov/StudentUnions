            	<p>Family Weekend is a long-standing tradition that gives families the opportunity
to become familiar with campus and all of the amazing people working with our
students everyday. This weekend is organized by the Associated Students of The
University of Arizona (ASUA) in order to give you, the parents, the siblings,
the children - a genuine student perspective of life at the UA.</p>

<p>In addition to the tremendous support we receive from the Arizona Student
Unions, we would like to thank the UA Parents &amp; Family Association, and Arizona
Athletics.</p>
