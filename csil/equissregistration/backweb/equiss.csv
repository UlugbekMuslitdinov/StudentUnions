Oprah,Revish,orevish@email.arizona.edu,non-average body type,,,no,n/a,Multiculturalism is conflict because it means many different cultures coming together. No two cultures are the same and the differences may cause conflict. However, I believe with conflicts come discussion and with discussions come a possibility for resolution. 
rae,strozzo,rstrozzo@email.arizona.edu,non-average body type,,,no,n/a,My understanding of multiculturalism is that it is a 90s term that has been replaced by the ideas of diversity. I have never thought of multiculturalism as conflict. i think that it could potentially create a space where folks are separated by their cultural differences and thereby ghettoize people rather than bringing new understanding. But my experience with that term has been pretty academic and really provided the only window to diversity in the small georgia town that i'm from.

Ana,Chandler,achandler@mac.com,adopted or foster care,,,no,N/A,I do not agree with the statement. Multi-culturalism is only conflict to some people because they are not open minded or comfortable about gaining knowledge about a culture not their own. If the world was more appreciative of difference, and did not see it as a problem, or lack understanding, America would be better off. There will always be different people in the world, and until we as a nation learn to understand and respect people of different cultures, our country will always see conflict. But if people can help each other understand that difference are beautiful, America would be much healthier and pleasant place to live in.  An organization that embraces multi-culturalism is a strong organization.  My grandfather was in the hospital last week.  The team of doctors that helped diagnose this gastro-intestinal problem looked like the United Nations.  This team of doctors works for the leading organization in medical treatments and health care.  This could not be possible if the Mayo Clinic did not embrace multi-culturalism.  This is definitely one organization where it is evident that multi-culturalism is knowledge, growth, and success.

Erin Ashley,Hall,eahall@arizona.edu,seriously or terminally ill,,,no,None,Conflict can arise from multiculturalism, but it is the unwillingness to reach out and accept others for who they truly are that creates conflict  between cultures. Respect, love, and a willingness to communicate and celebrate differences can allow multiculturalism to flourish with minimal conflict.
Miriam,Thompson,met3@email.arizona.edu,learning disability,,,no,,Sadly, we live in a world where people and cultures do not coexist peacefully. This refusal to coexist peacefully has resulted in unnecessary wars, deaths, and political and religious schisms. Refusal to accept and appreciate different cultures is fueling our own ignorance and shaping how our children view the world. The United States is a testament to that statement because of our own inability to readily accept or adapt to change. The label of the “ugly American” is a perfect fit in description of the United States. Our inability to speak other languages and our dream to globalize English depicts the average American as lazy and self-righteous. The majority of the world views as being blissfully oblivious and ignorant to other cultures and complacent. No longer should Americans bear this shameful title. 
Katherine,Francel,katherine.francel@uwrf.edu,emotional disability,,,yes,N/A,Multiculturalism is sometimes viewed as conflict in that people have a hard time getting along with those that think differently than themselves. It is easier to spend time with people similar to yourself becuase there will be less disagreements. However, disagreements often lead to progress. By working with others new opinions and options come to light that are very beneficial for the well being of the project.

Nolan,Majors,nmajors@email.arizona.edu,English language learner,,,no,Normal,I disagree with the statement "Multiculturalism is conflict."  Using my definition of culture as stated above and my unique lexicon of conflict.  According to me, conflict is just disagreement.  This is not specifically disagreement of persons for conflict can arise between ideas, perceptions, and language.  Since cultures are in essence a conglomerate of views and beliefs the idea that where more than one culture is, conflict may arise is easy to realize.  In other words, if two groups hold different notions of something, that qualifies as two cultures and also qualifies as conflict.  I must then conclude that conflict is an essential product or result of multiculturalism.  I would not go so far as to say that "multiculturalism is conflict" because the two are distinct.  I would instead claim that they are strongly related.

Ana,Terminel Iberri,nisa_terminel@hotmail.com,immigrant,,,no,none,Multiculturalism can cause conflict when members of a society are unaware of the benefits and of the beauty that can come from it.  I have always been taught to value diversity for the simple fact that it makes life interesting . Without diversity, our world would be bland, plain, and completely boring. It is through diversity that greatest of ideas have emerged in our society. Having an awareness and understanding of cultures around the world can become a tool of utmost importance. It is necessary for us as leaders to set a goal of encouraging and persuading members of our society to view diversity as a positive element . The amount of conflict arising in our world is staggering. Martin Luther King Jr. once said, “We must learn to live together as brothers or perish together as fools.”  If we do not find a way to reduce the amount of conflict due to a difference as simple as culture, the world will only continue to worsen. It is our duty and responsibility to make people aware of the fact that multiculturalism does not have to cause conflict, but rather it can create a stronger union in the  human race.
Melinda,Ostrander,M.Ostrander2@gmail.com,non-average body type,,,no,None,I believe that this statement is also founded on ignorance or lack of awareness.  Multiculturalism does cause conflict, but-- it doesn't have to if both cultures seek to understand and accept each other.  Conflict arises when there isn't a strong emphasis on communication and both cultures feel their culture to be superior.  Through education and awareness conflict between cultures can be resolved. 
Christopher,MacPhee,macpheec@email.arizona.edu,veteran,,,no,Just a bit of time in the evening for meditation,Multiculturalism is survival.  An ecologically diverse system is a rugged system.  Should a substantial change be introduced to the environment, a great many of the species would die but a select few would survive and given a long enough timeline, these survivors would then adapt and evolve traits appropriate to the new environment and populate a new ecology in line with the reality experienced.
In much the same way a society must allow for a competitive market of idea’s to ensure that concepts outmoded by its people are allowed to pass into history to make way for more efficient and relevant concepts.  Understanding all the while that in time these too must pass; through constant reevaluation of a culture’s values and beliefs a society infuses itself with the strength and passion of its people.
It is not a point of contention to say that a revolution is a temporary thing.  The weight of revolution carries meaning only insofar as the sentiment of its incitement carries weight with the people.  As time passes and this memory is removed, so too are the lessons derived from it thus a new revolution must take place in which the demons of the next generation are addressed.  In this way a culture infused with foreign ideas meaningful to the era.
The only universal experience among all living things is change. If a culture wishes to survive then it must obey the laws of life and change according to the demands placed upon it.  No one people can or should remain in power eternally, no ideals should dominate for all time.  The only way to ensure a societies survival is to allow it to grow with its people.

Shante,Womack,swomack@email.arizona.edu,non-traditional college aged,,,no,N/A,.
Samuel,Lewis,samlewis@ksu.edu,veteran,,,no,N/A,Multiculturalism is conflict because many people do not know how to interact with people that come from cultures that are different than their own. As evidenced by time as a student at Kansas State it is clearly obvious that many of the students here have lived sheltered lives. I wouldn’t say that we have conflict here. That would be too harsh of a definition. I feel that more or less many students are educated about differences and 
Francine,Woman Dress,fwomandr@email.arizona.edu,emancipated minor,,,no,,I think multiculturalism is a part of life. We are all unique collectively and as individuals. I don't think we would want it any other way. I think everyone wants to be different on some level. We should appreciate all cultures and differences. We shouldn't look at multiculturalism as a conflict but as unique differences and see what each culture has to offer.

Justin,Howes,justinio@email.arizona.edu,adopted or foster care,,,no,,Multiculturalism is conflict in the sense that cultures in contact often produce “social friction”; that is, a lack of understanding of one culture by another (and the possible subsequent assumptions made) can create conflict, especially when these cultures coexist within communities. For example, conflict may arise if a Thai family moves into a predominantly French community due to differences in language, family structures, and customs. Multiculturalism in particular tends to be accompanied by conflict because by definition it implies that more than one culture coexists in the same community, and since many cultures are either not knowledgeable or very poorly informed about other cultures, assumptions are made, stereotypes are projected, and misunderstandings arise. The key, then, is to dispel myths and raise awareness about various cultures to develop an understanding of, appreciation for, and respect for all cultures.
Ali,Weber,aweber@email.arizona.edu,emotional disability,,,no,Home in Tucson,Multiculturalism is conflict only when the contrasting cultures refuse to look past  their own comfort zones.  When a person is placed in a setting where their ideas and beliefs aren't the only ones, they often become defensive, refusing to look closely at the possibilities that exist in others' ideas and beliefs.  Conflict arises only with closed minds, for an open mind, willing to take a risk and try to understand another's culture can only walk away a more enlightened being.  Multiculturalism is not conflict, but possibility.  When we can all learn from each other, the world will be a brighter place.
Calla,Thomas,clthomas1@students.pima.edu,veteran,,,no,n/a,We that statement totally goes against the meaning of multiculturalism, how can something that is supposed to be peaceful be a conflict? I personally think that t first there might be some conflicts because of they way things are today. What I want to know is why are people waiting until now to want to do something? And why are we only doing things like this in privileged neighborhoods? I know that when I was back in Lincoln Heights no one wanted to educate us on things like multiculturalism. I also like to know how and why are people going to care about multiculturalism when they have other things to worry about like eating or trying to get out of that trap of a neighborhood? I know that all this is a good thing but honestly what good is it going to do by just sitting here talking about it? Fredrick Douglas didn’t talk, W.E.B.Du Bois didn’t just talk, and Harriet Tubman didn’t just talk they we’re people of action. So I’m just curious as to what actions we are going to take to get people to care about multiculturalism and it’s being a conflict?
Carmen,Bradford,floetryizme@yahoo.com,non-average body type,,,yes,,Multiculturalism is a conflict if we let it become a conflict.  The definition itself states that it is the doctrine that several different cultures (rather than one national culture) can coexist peacefully and equitably in a single country.  Now sometimes it's hard to appreciate others differences, that's a conflict.  Sometimes it's hard to respect others religious views and values, that’s a conflict.  Sometimes the color of ones skin is just a little to hard to look past, that's a conflict.  But the concept of Multiculturalism isn't a conflict, just a dream that's far away.
