<h1>How to Use Your Swipe Meal Plan</h1>
</p>

<h2><u>Using Your Swipe Meal Plan</u></h2>
<p>
	When you’re ready to eat on campus and you want to use one of your meal swipes, all you have to do is <strong>follow these three steps</strong>:
</p>
<p>
<ol style="margin-left:30px; line-height:150%">
  <li>Go to the <u>cashier</u> and say “Hello, I'm part of the Swipe Plan”.</li>
  <li>Select your meal from the options available on the restaurant's Swipe Menu. We recommend saving the Swipe Menus to your smartphone for quick and easy access on the go.</li>
  <li>Provide your CatCard to the cashier and use one swipe as payment to complete your order.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
	Remember, <!--<b>you may only use one swipe per meal period</b> (see below) and--> <b>you must go to the cashier to order.</b> Meal Swipes <u>cannot</u> be used as a form of payment at order kiosks.	
</p>
<p>
	If you’re craving something from one of the franchise locations on campus (listed below), you must use your CatCa$h to complete your purchase. <b>Meal Swipes are NOT eligible for use at:</b>
<ul style="margin-left:50px; line-height:150%">
    <li>Chick-fil-A</li>
	<li>Einstein Bros. Bagels</li>
	<li>Panda Express</li>
	<li>Papa John’s Pizza</li>
	<li>Starbucks</li>
	<li>Steak 'n Shake</li>
	<li>The Den</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2><u>Meal Periods</u></h2>
<!-- <p>
	There are five meal periods each day:
<ul style="margin-left:50px; line-height:150%"> 
    <li>Period 1: 4:15am-10:59am</li>
	<li>Period 2: 11:00am-2:59pm</li>
	<li>Period 3: 3:00pm-6:59pm</li>
	<li>Period 4: 7:00pm-11:59pm</li>
	<li>Period 5: 12:00am-4:14am</li>
</ul>
</p> -->
<p>
NOTE: The Swipe Plan week starts on Monday at 4:15am and ends the following Monday at 4:14am. For the Santa Rita and Rincon Swipe Plans, any unused meal swipes on Monday at 4:14am will expire. At 4:15am on Monday, your meal swipes will automatically reset to the respective amount of swipes your plan allots per week. 
</p>

<h2><u>How many swipes do I have left?</u></h2>
<p>
It's Wednesday at 4:30pm and you can't remember how many swipes you've used this week. Don't worry, call the Meal Plan Office at 520-621-7043 to find out how many swipes you have left for the week. The Meal Plan Office is open Monday through Friday from 8:00am to 5:00pm.	
</p>

<h2><u>Help! I need more swipes!</u></h2>
<p>
	If you run out of meal swipes during the week, we recommend you:
</p>
<p>
<ol style="margin-left:30px; line-height:150%">
	<li>Add money to your <a href="https://catcash.arizona.edu">CatCa$h account</a> to hold you over until your swipes reset on Monday at 4:15am.</li>
  <li>Visit the Meal Plan Office to purchase additional swipes for $10 each.</li>
  <li>Upgrade to the Santa Rita or Catalina Swipe Plan if you’re consistently running out of swipes each week.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<!-- <h2><u>I tried the Swipe Plan, but it's not for me. What now?</u></h2>
<p>
	You may opt-out of your Swipe Plan and convert the remaining balance to a Wildcat Meal Plan at any time. We will ask you for some feedback to help us understand why you want to opt-out, and then we’ll convert your Swipe Plan to a Wildcat Meal Plan. Swipe Plans will be prorated as follows:
<ul style="margin-left:50px; line-height:150%"> 
    <li>Santa Rita and Rincon Swipe Plans will be rounded up to the next week, and the remaining weeks in the academic year will be valued at the respective swipes per week of your plan at a rate of $10 per swipe.</li>
	<li>Catalina Plus Swipe Plans will be rounded up to the next week, and the remaining weeks in the academic year will be valued at 18 swipes per week at a rate of $10 per swipe.</li>
</ul>
</p> -->
