			<td>Wanted! The return of tableware and coffee cups that have been mysteriously disappearing from the Student Union Memorial building.
				<p><img height="198" width="243" src="/traditions/scrapbook/history11coffee.jpg" align="right">Marvin &quot;Swede&quot; Johnson, Student Union Director, is asking the student who have taken the 1,048 coffee cups to return them to room 201.</p>
				<p>&quot;Many committees and students have taken the cups for souvenirs or for mixing paints,&quot; said Swede. &quot;I will gladly, upon their return, exchange them for chipped ones from the Catsbah and cafeteria.&quot;</p>
				<p>In addition to the disappearing cups, 452 forks, 408 knives, 242 soup spoons, 2,880 teaspoons, 517 eight oz glasses and 260 twelve oz glasses are missing. Approximately $1,048 in tableware has been stolen from the Union in the past year.</p>
				<p>The IBM clock which used to hang on the second floor was ripped out of the wall and several thermostat covers have disappeared.</p>
