			<td>Have there been weird monsters rattling your nerves this week? Don&#146;t panic! They are spreading news of the SU Birthday party and they are really members of the ASUA publicity committee.
				<p>This eerie activity will begin Monday November 9, 1958. Any self respecting ghoul wouldn&#146;t dare miss it.</p>
				<p><img height="218" width="310" src="/traditions/scrapbook/history13ghoulsa.jpg" align="left">Every year the Student Union Memorial building celebrates its birthday with a theme party. This year, for the seventh party, the Union is having a night of &quot;Terror.&quot;</p>
				<p>Wherever a guest goes in the Student Union Monday night, there will be a new fright, from the ballroom to Louies.</p>
				<p>Those who are not afraid of death by beheading (beware the guillotine) will want to rock and roll to the Casuals, eat pizza a five cents a serving and drink wtches&#146; brew in Louies.</p>
				<p>The way to this marriment houwever, is guarded by a labyrinth. Frankenstein&#146;s henchmen lurk here, hunting for volunteers to become monsters, or brave souls interested in a tour of the UA&#146;s troture chambers.</p>
				<p>Anyone with a faint heart might ish to take in milder en<img height="317" width="220" src="history13ghoulsb.jpg" align="right">teretanment a movie perhaps? Ghoulia will play host for the son of Dracula in the cafateria.</p>
				<p>Are there any Southerners in the crowd? SU suggest the former Coop. It has become an &quot;Okeefenokee&quot; type swamp for the evening complete with Wayne Sander&#146;s Dixieland band.</p>
				<p>The alligator wandering around won&#146;t be foooling. He&#146;s authentic as are the witches and goblins. Perhaps the shack out in back belongs to Pogo. The snakes in the trees are supposed to be harmless but watch out, anything can happen at the &quot;Night of Terror.&quot;</p>
				<p>All sorts of celebrities will be wandering around in the ballroom. Charles Addams and his family will be there, and it&#146;s anyone&#146;s guess who&#146;s the hangman in the jr. Ballroom&#151;Tom Dooley perhaps.</p>
				<p>SU director Billy Joe Varney has volunteered to be cadaver for the embalming demonstrations. Graves will be available to all guests and &quot;Death&quot; will be handing out death certificates. Larry Barker&#146;s Playboys will also be playing.</p>
				<p>At 10pm, the whole party will converge in the ballroom for the cutting of the cake. The Student Union will be closed in the moring so SUAB members can decorate the Union.</p>
