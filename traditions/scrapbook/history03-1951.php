But the result was worth the waiting, watching, and campus disruption. At last there was an adequate cafeteria, with a giant central kitchen, along with lounges, meeting rooms, and offices for various student groups. The two ballrooms provided a dancing area for 1,000 couples and banquet seating for 600. There was a browsing library and music listening rooms. A separate dining and lounge area was provided for faculty use. The basement contained a post office and games rooms, with a large area still available for further expansion.
				<p>In its first year of operation the Student Union had approximately 100 employees and a gross income of #370,651. It served over 11/2 million people. There were over 1,800 separate meetings, conferences, teas, receptions, and dances sponsored by 293 different groups composed of students, faculty, alumni, and the public. All this was administered by a director and the Student Union Activities Board.</p>

			<td><b>Front Entrance 1951</b>
				<p>This sculpture-mural at the front entrance was the creation of Phillips Sanderson, then Professor of Art at Arizona State College at Tempe (later to become Arizona State University). Costing $6,000 it was, and still is, a subject of controversy, though its creator explained that it &quot;symbolizes the turmoil and disillusionment of war&quot; (the group of figures which looks something like a football confrontation) &quot;and the desire for peace&quot; (the tall figure being an abstract dove; note eye in curve of head in middle and upward sweep of wing).</p>
