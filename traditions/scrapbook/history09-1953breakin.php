			<td>An unknown person broke into the Student Union early Saturday morning, taking approximately $75 from pin ball machines and leaving traces of blood in his wake.
				<p>Entry was gained by breaking into the northside of the building. Traces of blood were found around the window indicating the burglar may have cut himself on broken glass.</p>
				<p>The window broken into belonged to Charles &quot;Bumps&quot; Tribolet, graduate manager.</p>
				<p>&quot;Someone who knows the building fairly well is probably responsible for the break in,&quot; Union director Marvin Johnson said. &quot;It was probably a student.&quot;</p>
