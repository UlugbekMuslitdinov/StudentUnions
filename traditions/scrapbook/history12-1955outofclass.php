			<td>Learning from books isn&#146;t enough for the girls in the Institutional foods class. It&#146;s practical experience that counts.
				<p>Where do they get their experience? Why in the modernly electrical equipped Student Union. The students spend three laboratory hours twice a week in the Kitchens and one lecture class per week.</p>
				<p>The class includes two types of instruction: quantity cooking and food service. In the quantity cooking class, the girls spend time in all of the different kitchens including the bakery, salad room and butcher shop. One special assignment to completed by the end of the semester is to cut up a butchered side of beef.</p>
				<p>While working in these food service areas, they are treated as employees. They schedule work hours with their supervisor, have time cards and are excused from lab to compensate for the time spent working.</p>
				<p>All this training prepares the food service personnel for jobs in the airlines, hospitals and other institutions, hotels, and school cafeterias. But it also gives them valuable knowledge for life after marriage.</p>
