<p>More than 600 persons attended Friday&#146;s open house in the new Park Student Center, fifth Street and Park Avenue, which opened yesterday.
</p>
<p><img height="265" width="220" src="history17park.jpg" align="right" alt="Dining in the Student Union">Students generally expressed the opinion that the building was beautiful and they were excited about its opening.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems very efficient. The wood paneling makes it a very relaxing place to eat,&quot; said Bill Allen, BPA junior.</p>
<p>&quot;The dish washing machine is fantastic,&quot; said Kitty McCaslin, LA freshman. &quot;The entire operation is automatic.&quot;</p>
<p>Peggy Rosencranz, on the fifty employees that will operate the center, said, &quot;All of the students seem to be very impressed by the kitchen, which is entirely stainless steel. I&#146;m very proud to work here.&quot;</p>
<p>The cafeteria is supposed to work on a scramble system where as many self-automated machines as possible will be put on the food lines.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#146;s robot-like,&quot; Sherrie Hunt, LA freshman said. &quot;But the carpet makes it seem like a really respectable place to eat.&quot;</p>
<p>The center was designed to serve the Law College and about 1,000 students living in residence halls on the westside of campus. Two new halls will also use the centers services.</p>
