<p><i>Proposed Student Union Memorial Building. This sketch, appearing in a promotional brochure, was the future building's entrance. Facing the Main Gate, it was to be constructed on the flagpole-area in front of Old Main.</i></p>
<hr noshade size="1">
<p>The idea of a student recreational building had been proposed by President Cloyd Heck Marvin back in 1923, but it was not until March 1938 that the interest in such a building caused then President Alfred Atkinson to appoint a committee to draw up some plans and suggestions as to what should be in the proposed Student Union. This committee and a later one formed in 1940 were unable to obtain the necessary funding or to agree on a site particularly when it was suggested that the new building replace Old Main. The advent of World War II put an end to all plans temporarily, but provided a new and inspiring reason for pursuing its realization: a memorial to the students and faculty who had given their lives in both World Wars. Once again, in 1945, a committee was appointed, with W. Roy Wayland, Phoenix banker, as head, and a monumental fund-raising campaign began which was to cover the State, reach out to all UA friends and alumni, and last until the last dollar was obtained or promised. The original objective was $750,000, but by 1949 the goal had risen to $1,000,000. Plans were drawn up, rejected, redrawn. Various facilities were proposed, discussed, eliminated (such as a barber shop, a beauty shop, chapel, haberdashery, a visitor&#146;s dormitory). Most emotional and vociferous was the struggle over the site, even when a compromise (some thought) was announced that Old Main would be left intact so much had been invested by the Navy in its rehabilitation and the Student Union would be constructed in the limited area in front of it. Fortunately wiser heads in time ruled out this plan, which would have made impossible any future structural additions necessitated by a growing student body.</p>
<p>The final cost would be about $1,200,000 for construction and furnishings. One third of this came from the State Legislature, which recognized the need and obligation to furnish dining facilities for the growing enrollment. (The old inadequate Dining Hall was to be torn down.) One third was raised by alumni, faculty, students, corporations, and the general public. The remainder came from the sale of bonds which were to be paid off with income from student fees and sale of services.</p>
<p>It was in the last year of President McCormick&#146;s term that ground was broken for the first phase of the Union&#146;s construction, not to be completed until his successor, Richard A. Harvill, had assumed the presidency.</p>
