			<td colspan="2">Union funds are being diverted to support vice on campus, a special grand jury decided this week. Indictments have been issued against Marvin &quot;Greed&quot; Johnson and Billy &quot;the kid&quot; Larson.
				<p><img height="158" width="220" src="/traditions/scrapbook/history13vice.jpg" align="right">Johnson, head of the 9,000 member coop-loafers club, said there was nothing wrong with the way he spent an estimated $45 of surplus student funds that were employed by him.</p>
				<p>According to the grand jury report, $3.14 went to cigars, $5.36 to angostura, $36 for a bathtub, 39 cents for dog biscuits and 50 cents for ice cream cones.</p>
				<p>Johnson admitted that some people might not approve of his habits including putting angostura in his coop coffee to give it a distinct bitter flavor.</p>
				<p>&quot;My plans are to make my coffee so bitter that no one else can stand it,&quot; Johnson said. &quot;My plan backfired a bit when students kept drinking my coffee.&quot;</p>
				<p>By keeping students away from his coffee, &quot;Greed&quot; said students would always be thirsty so he and Billy &quot;the kid&quot; Larson could then sell their bootleg booze at the Union during cocktail hour.</p>
				<p>&quot;I learned da racket durin&#146; da depression,&quot; Johnson said.</p>
				<p>The ice cream cones were used to bribe Larson.</p>
