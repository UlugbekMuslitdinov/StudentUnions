			<td>The Student Union, the University&#146;s largest business, is having trouble keeping up with the number of customers.
				<p>Last year, the Union had over three million customers, an increase of almost two million in the last decade.</p>
				<p>Last year they bought 75,000 of milk from the food service facilities. They also ate 185,000 servings of green beans. 200,000 hamburgers, 425,000 doughnuts, 400,000 eggs and 1,750,000 slices of bread.</p>
				<p>They drank 300,000 glasses of coffee, 350,000 glasses of Coca-Cola, 50,000 glasses of orange juice and 90,000 servings of lemonade.</p>
				<p>To cope with this constantly increasing volume of business, the Union will build an extension to the food service facilities where the parking lot behind the Kaibab-Huachuca residence hall now stands.</p>
				<p><img height="205" width="275" src="/traditions/scrapbook/history17growth.jpg" align="right">The SU director said that the new addition will be two stories with a sub-basement and room for three more additional floors.</p>
				<p>&quot;Bids were extended in October and we hope to start building in January so the new facilities will be ready by next September,&quot; he said. &quot;We plan to spend $800,000 and the state legislature will appropriate $600,000 for this purpose.</p>
				<p>It will be the third extension since the Union was built in 1951. The present facility can accommodate 18,000 persons and there are about that number of students here now.</p>
				<p>The out-of-state and non-Tucson students depend on the Student Union. They get their meals there and relax in one of the lounges or games rooms.</p>
				<p>The seat of student government is there and bookstore, which passes off profits to students, is located on the SU Arcade.</p>
				<p>Also within the Union is a check cashing counter, the offices of the University publications and even a place where telegrams can be sent.</p>
				<p>There are many more services such as banquet halls, and information desk and a lost and found.</p>
