			<td>The year-old Student Union Memorial building at the University of Arizona is really something&#151;so much of a something it would almost be worthwhile for alumni of the school to re-register just to make use of it.
				<p>One-time students of the school who remember the &quot;rec&quot; hall in the basement of the Women&#146;s building and later Old Main and who can recall trips to the University &quot;square&quot; would be astounded to see what the Union building offers.</p>
				<p>In operation since Nov., 1951, the building has rapidly made its place secure as the center of student life on campus. It&#146;s practically a city within itself, and when planned additions are made it will be just that.</p>
				<p><img height="228" width="275" src="/traditions/scrapbook/history09complete.jpg" align="right">Constructed and furnished at a cost in excess of $1 million, the Student Union Memorial building is dedicated to the U of A boys who died in World Wars I and II. There are no membership cards&#151;students pay a $5 fee each semester for its use.</p>
				<p>The struggle to build the center was a long and strenuous one but it was financed eventually through the issuance of bonds, a legislative approach through the Board of Regents and donations.</p>
				<p>The building has to pay for itself, Marvin Johnson, the Student Union Director emphasized. That it will do so is a pretty sure thing since in its first year of operation the financial picture showed a little better than breaking even.</p>
				<p>In 1951-52, the income was $370,000 with a typical sample month, being May, when $39,559 worth of business was done.</p>
				<p>That the students are using the facility is easily proved; for the last year 283 organizations met there, making a total among them of 1,507 in reservations. Banquets for groups ranging in number from five to 612 were arranged and total of 16,244 persons were served during the 297 banquets held.</p>
				<p>If you&#146;re interested in figures, 49,823 players made use of the pool, billiards and Ping-Pong tables and other facilities.</p>
				<p>Just what is in the Student Union building? Well first and foremost for the sightseer, there&#146;s the Bell from the USS Arizona hanging in the tower to be rung when any Wildcat sports team is victorious. The Arizona, you&#146;ll remember, was sunk in the Pearl Harbor raid.</p>
				<p>The main lounge is for relaxing and the Catsbah is the place to grab a coke, sandwich, or cup of coffee. The huge kitchen serves three meals a day each weekday and twice on Sunday.</p>
				<p>For the student dances and for Sunday night movies, the large junior and senior ballrooms are joined together. Otherwise, they can be divided for separate functions.</p>
				<p>The union building consists of two separate wings, north or service wing and south or office wing, which are joined by a covered terrace.</p>
