				<p>With several large dormitories being constructed on the west side of Park Avenue, many blocks from Student Union facilities, this food service center, at the conrer of Park and 5th street, boasted a cafeteria that could accommodate 500 persons and a branch of the SU book store. Its preliminary drawings revealed that it could be expanded to five floors. In the background can be seen two of the women&#146;s dormitories, a portion of Arizona-Sonora at the left and Coronado, nearing completion, in the center.</p>
