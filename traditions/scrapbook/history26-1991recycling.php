<p>The recycling program will begin Nov. 8 and recyclable polystyrene take out containers are expected to be on Student Union Food Services&#146; shelves by Nov. 4, said Kim Morter, chair of the Student Union Activities Board&#146;s Education by Example committee, which pushes recycling efforts around campus.</p>
<p>The committee already has bins in the Student Union to collect paper, newsprint and aluminum cans for recycling.</p>
<p>The Student Union will not make any money off the recycling efforts but will only have to wages to those who collect and compact the material, Morter said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is just to further our intent to make a dent in the recycling problem,&quot; Morter said.</p>

<p>Polystyrene foam, once a head-ache to environmentalists, soon will be collected for recycling at the Student Union and Park Student Center.</p>
