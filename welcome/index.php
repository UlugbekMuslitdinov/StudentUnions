    	<h2>WILDCAT WELCOME 2010</h2>
        <p>
Welcome, New Wildcats, to The University of Arizona! Every summer we help you to start the school year off right with a warm welcome and an overview of the opportunities here on campus. Spend your first twelve days on campus doing activities that will acclimate you to the resources available from the UA and Tucson communities. 
        </p>
        <p>
Many of these programs are free and fun, and a much better way to see what's happening on campus than reading a map the first day of classes. So, get involved in campus life, and see how it will make a difference to your college experience. 
        </p>
