<h2>Student Union Memorial Center Chosen For New Name</h2>
<p>The Student Union has a long tradition of remembering the sacrifices made by the crew of the USS Arizona and we wish to continue doing so for many years to come. That was the response we heard from you as well.</p>
<p>To keep this tradition alive and well the name of the new student union building is: <b>Student Union Memorial Center</b>.</p>
