Restaurants, the bookstore, Fast Copy, Sam's Place, the Post Office, U-Mart, the Center for Student Involvement &amp; Leadership, and all other regular services will remain open during the entire construction period, which will be in two phases. Here's how it&#146;s going to work.</td>

<h3>Phase I</h3>
<p>(16&#150;18 months, COMPLETED!)</p>
<p><img height="163" width="108" src="phasesModelpic.jpg" align="right" alt="model picture">During Phase I, the east end of the Union was torn down, including Gallagher theater, Sam's Place, the Cactus lounge, the Union Club and meeting rooms. The rest of the Union continued to function as usual: the bookstore was untouched, all the restaurants were also left open, Sam's Place was relocated to the 1st level and Gallagher Theater was moved temporarily to other facilities on campus.</p>
<p>On the east side of the Union, new restaurants have been built with indoor/outdoor seating. On the northwest side, a new bookstore is now finished, along with an underground loading dock. Now that Phase I is completed students are able to eat in the new restaurants; buy their books at the new bookstore, and continue to receive services as always.</p>

<h3>Phase II</h3>
<p>(15-18 months, expected completion December 2002)</p>
<p><img height="171" width="108" src="phasesModelpic2.jpg" align="left">In Phase II, the middle and western sides of the old building are being demolished and rebuilt with new ballrooms, a new theater/multi-purpose auditorium, expanded food court, a highly enhanced USS Arizona memorial lounge, career services, student government offices, and spaces to meet or hang out. The new Student Union/UA Bookstore will once again be the heartbeat of the campus.</p>
