	  Structures are allowed only between 8 am and 5 pm. unless specifically

		<br>
	<li>Please be advised that chairs and tables from the Student Union (patio areas, food court areas including outside and inside) are NOT to be used for mall events. Those tables and chairs are there for use by individuals <b>doing business at the Student Union only</b>. A mall event is not a Student Union event.<br>
		<br>
	<li><b>If the event involves food and/or beverages</b>, prior approval is required by the Catering Office 621-1989.<br>
		<br>
