<h1>Vendor Fairs</h1>
<p>
No time to shop? No car? No worries! Vendor Fairs bring local businesses right to the UA Mall so you can get Wildcat student specials without spending any gas.  Several times a year, look for the tents for all kinds of goods and services like furniture, makeup, clothing, appliances, bikes, newspapers, banking, posters, and seasonable items. 
</p>
<p>
And if you need to feel good about your extravagant purchases, you can. The dollars you spend will help support the Wildcat Activities Board in their endeavors to bring great speakers, films and comedians to campus.
