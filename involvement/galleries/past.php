        <p>Elizabeth Mellott tells us about war and the consequent tearing apart of relationships. She draws from her own raw experience, yet delivers it to us in a universal human language, that of concern for family and loved ones. We all feel sorrow, loss, absence and anxiety. Moving through her work we are not presented with a voice of authority or historical expertise, but one that finds our common denominator. This is precisely why the work of Elizabeth Mellott is so powerful..</p><br />
